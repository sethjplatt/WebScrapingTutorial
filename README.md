## Web Scraping Tutorial

While working on a recent project called 🍌[BANaNAS](https://data-banana.com)🍌 I had the opportunity to implement some web scraping using Python and Beautiful Soup. I love web scraping, so I wanted to make a short tutorial on the basics for others who would like to explore it.

This repository was created alongside my [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@contact.sethjplatt/data-scraping-with-python-and-beautiful-soup-1f32848c2b5c). It's about a five minute read, or about thirty minutes to follow along!

Happy Scraping 🖥️ 🤘
